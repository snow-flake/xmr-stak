	 * LARGE PAGE SUPPORT
	 * Large pages need a properly set up OS. It can be difficult if you are not used to systems administration,
	 * but the performance results are worth the trouble - you will get around 20% boost. Slow memory mode is
	 * meant as a backup, you won't get stellar results there. If you are running into trouble, especially
	 * on Windows, please read the common issues in the README.
	 *
	 * By default we will try to allocate large pages. This means you need to "Run As Administrator" on Windows.
	 * You need to edit your system's group policies to enable locking large pages. Here are the steps from MSDN
	 *
	 * 1. On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type gpedit.msc.
	 * 2. On the Local Group Policy Editor console, expand Computer Configuration, and then expand Windows Settings.
	 * 3. Expand Security Settings, and then expand Local Policies.
	 * 4. Select the User Rights Assignment folder.
	 * 5. The policies will be displayed in the details pane.
	 * 6. In the pane, double-click Lock pages in memory.
	 * 7. In the Local Security Setting â€“ Lock pages in memory dialog box, click Add User or Group.
	 * 8. In the Select Users, Service Accounts, or Groups dialog box, add an account that you will run the miner on
	 * 9. Reboot for change to take effect.
	 *
	 * Windows also tends to fragment memory a lot. If you are running on a system with 4-8GB of RAM you might need
	 * to switch off all the auto-start applications and reboot to have a large enough chunk of contiguous memory.
	 *
	 * On Linux you will need to configure large page support "sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=128" and increase your
	 * ulimit -l. To do do this you need to add following lines to /etc/security/limits.conf - "* soft memlock 262144"
	 * and "* hard memlock 262144". You can also do it Windows-style and simply run-as-root, but this is NOT
	 * recommended for security reasons.
	 *
	 * Memory locking means that the kernel can't swap out the page to disk - something that is unlikely to happen on a
	 * command line system that isn't starved of memory. I haven't observed any difference on a CLI Linux system between
	 * locked and unlocked memory. If that is your setup see option "no_mlck".
	 *
	 *
	 * use_slow_memory defines our behaviour with regards to large pages. There are three possible options here:
	 * always  - Don't even try to use large pages. Always use slow memory.
	 * warn    - We will try to use large pages, but fall back to slow memory if that fails.
	 * no_mlck - This option is only relevant on Linux, where we can use large pages without locking memory.
	 *           It will never use slow memory, but it won't attempt to mlock
	 * never   - If we fail to allocate large pages we will print an error and exit.
